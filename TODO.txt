- Examine the i2dl scripts
- Write own utilites
- Write a sample autoencoder
- Add some tests?
- Adjust readme

1) Dataloaders
- implement Dataset classes deriving from the pytorch base class to manage the datasets from predefined links, to be used as model inputs
- add file extracting utilities
- add plotting utilities
^ everything can be packed into one wrapper class
- allow for custom transformations of the input data
- allow to load into memory, if it suffices

2) Trainers
- add a trainer class that implements the training loop on pytorch objects: datasets, models and optimizers
^ take in the objects at inti and manage them
^ in the end can store the model and load it again
